Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```lisp
(define (p) (p))
```  

```lisp
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```
Then he evaluates the expression

```lisp
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

-----
In the case of the applicative-order evaluation (leftmost innermost), the calculation of the function will be infinite, because the variable p will be infinitely expanded to itself.
In the case of the normal-order evaluation (leftmost outermost) the function will give the answer 0:
```lisp
(test 0 (p)) 
  
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) 
  
(if #t 0 (p)) 
  
0 
```
