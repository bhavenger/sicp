Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

```lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
    (+ (square x) (square y)))

(define (sum-of-squares-largest-two x y z)
    (cond 
        ((and (<= x y) (<= x z)) (sum-of-squares y z))
        ((and (<= y x) (<= y z)) (sum-of-squares x z))
        ((and (<= z x) (<= z y)) (sum-of-squaresx y))))

(sum-of-squares-largest-two 4 2 3)
```
