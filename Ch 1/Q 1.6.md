Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form.  
'Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?' she asks.  
Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:  

```lisp
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:  

```lisp
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:  

```lisp
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```  

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.  

---
Let's define all procedures first:  
```lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
    guess
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```  

After we replace if with new-if and try to perform the calculation, we get an error.  

```
;Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```  
The solution to this exercise is lie to q1.5, which tells us about special rules for calculating the `if` form. Eva Lu Ator substitutes if for a procedure which is calculated applicatively, which leads us to an infinite calculation of `sqrt-iter`.
