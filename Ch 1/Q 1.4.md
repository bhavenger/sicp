Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.   
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:  

```lisp
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```
If b > 0, we use plus as the operator, otherwise we use minus.
